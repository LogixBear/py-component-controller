Installation
======================

The py-component-controller project depends on both the selenium, and pyselenium-js packages.
Upon installation of this project, these two packages will automatically be installed.
Under the hood, py-component-controller currently relies on selenium version `3.6.0` and pyselenium-js `1.3.6`.
py-component-controller can be used on both python 2.7 and python 3.6, as well as the required packages listed above.

You can download the framework using pip like this:

    pip install pyscc

You may consider using virtualenv to create isolated Python environments.
