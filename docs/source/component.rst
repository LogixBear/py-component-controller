Components
==========

A component represents an area in the web application user interface that your test is interacting with.
Component objects were created to represent every possible element a controller and/or test would need to reference.
Component objects allow us to define an element once, and reference it however many times we need by it's defined property.
If any major changes are made to our target interface, we can change the definition of a component's property once and it will work across all of our given controllers and tests. Reference: `Page Object <http://www.guru99.com/page-object-model-pom-page-factory-in-selenium-ultimate-guide.html>`_
